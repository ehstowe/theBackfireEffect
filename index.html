<h1>Study Shows No Correlation Between a School's Total Revenue per Pupil and College/Career Readiness in Kentucky County Schools</h1>
<img src="ccrmoneychart.PNG"</img>
<p>This chart demonstrates the total revenue per pupil received by each county school district in the state of Kentucky mapped to 
  the school's college/career readiness percentage. There is no correlation between these values. 
Some schools that receive more money money have low percentages, and some schools that receive less money have higher percentages. 
The extreme outliers, which are Morgan and Martin County, do not have higher percentages than average.</p>
